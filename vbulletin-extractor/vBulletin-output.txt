1. I started noticing if I just type in my site without a "www" it goes to the site but i'm not logged in when I should be.  If I had a "www" and refresh - i'm logged in.  So it has something to do with the www vs non-www link - how can i stay logged in for either?

2. You should redirect all of your traffic to the proper domain be it www or non www, whatever is entered into the admincp

3. You can do it either by .htaccess file or forward the url to the www in your server's control panel

That's fine but the emails sent out have the www in them.  If you just go to domain.com it takes you there, but you're not logged in, it seems to be a cookie issue.

What would my .htaccess need to say or what would I need to add to it?

5. Do you use .htaccess or not?
Do search on it and you will learn more about it's use
Again, you could forward your domain in control panel on your server

Like in cPanel?  I apologize for the newbie questions and all - maybe i'm just having a brain fart day.

7. No need to apologize, it looks like it would be easier for you to just go to your cPanel and forward the domain to www

8. Add the following to an .htaccess file in the root of your site to redirect www.domain.com to just domain.com:
Code:
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www\.(.+)$ &#91;NC&#93;
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://%1/$1 &#91;R=301,L&#93;
If you don't have an .htaccess there already, create one with that and upload it. If you do, you should add that to it.

This would be closer to what I need. It seems if you don't use the "www" the cookies don't work from previous sessions. I need the non-www to forward to the www, I tried adding it in the cpanel and it created a redirect loop.... no other redirects listed.

This will redirect non-www to www:
Code:
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^www\.
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.%{HTTP_HOST}/$1 &#91;R=301,L&#93;
