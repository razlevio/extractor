1. I like to display a horizontal list of tags / categories assigned to different Topics. On click this, users can view only Topic titles. Is it possible?

2. Not sure what you mean, can you explain a bit more please?

3. Just like categories in Wordpress blog.

Board
--Forum
----Topic 1 about Cat
----Topic 2 about Rat
----Topic 3 about Cat
----Topic 4 about Rat
----Topic 5 about Tiger

Few buttons near footer: CAT, RAT, TIGER

Users when click 'RAT' then he /she may view:

Board
--Forum
----Topic 2 about Rat
----Topic 4 about Rat

4. Can anyone help me please.

this is not something that phpbb does. it does not have "tags"  like a blog does.

you would have to try to find someone to write up a MOD for something like this.

try the MOD release forum and/or the MOD request forum here.
